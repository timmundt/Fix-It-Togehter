# Generally 

This repository is a project work at the HWR Berlin in the module full stack development. Our idea is a platform-based website where people with broken coffee machines and people that can fix broken coffee machines can connect together. The repository includes our source code and the documentation of our project.

We hosted a website from our documentation via GitHub pages. 
Link to the website -> https://timmundt.github.io/Fix-It-Togehter/

 >Note: Some sections of the documentation are under construction and will be completed in the future.
